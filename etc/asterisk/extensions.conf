;; some subroutines

[stdexten]
;
; Standard extension subroutine:
;   ${EXTEN} - Extension
;   ${ARG1} - Device(s) to ring
;   ${ARG2} - Optional context in Voicemail
;
; Note that the current version will drop through to the next priority in the
; case of their pressing '#'.  This gives more flexibility in what do to next:
; you can prompt for a new extension, or drop the call, or send them to a
; general delivery mailbox, or...
;
; The use of the LOCAL() function is purely for convenience.  Any variable
; initially declared as LOCAL() will disappear when the innermost Gosub context
; in which it was declared returns.  Note also that you can declare a LOCAL()
; variable on top of an existing variable, and its value will revert to its
; previous value (before being declared as LOCAL()) upon Return.
